# lead-scoring-case-study
X Education, an online course provider for industry professionals, attracts many visitors to its website daily through marketing on various platforms like Google. These visitors may browse courses, fill out forms with their contact details, or watch videos, becoming classified as leads. Additionally, leads are generated through past referrals. Once leads are captured, the sales team reaches out via calls and emails, but only about 30% convert into customers.

Given the low conversion rate, X Education aims to streamline this process by identifying high-potential leads, or 'Hot Leads'. By doing so, the sales team can focus their efforts on leads more likely to convert, improving overall efficiency. The task is to develop a logistic regression model that assigns a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead. Higher scores indicate a greater likelihood of conversion, allowing targeted efforts towards these hot leads.

Additionally, the model should be adaptable to future requirements and address various business challenges. These challenges are detailed in a separate document, which should be considered when developing the model and included in the final presentation along with your recommendations.
